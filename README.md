# Phase-1 Project - Uwezo Soko Hub

- My name is James Nyamweya and I'm the author of this project.
- This is my Phase-1 Project at Moringa School.
- For this project, I'm going to build a Single Page Application (SPA).
- My frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.
- My application is called Uwezo Soko Hub.
- It is a web-based marketplace application where users can browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and simulate purchases.
- My user story for this app is it is a web-based marketplace where users can browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and simulate purchases.
- My M.V.Ps are:
1) Display a list of items.
2) Users can search by name or filter by category.
3) When an item is purchased, its stock reduces.
