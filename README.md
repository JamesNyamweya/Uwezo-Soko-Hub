My name is James Nyamweya and I'm the author of this project.
This is my Phase-1 Project at Moringa School.
For this project, I'm going to build a Single Page Application (SPA).
My frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.
My application is called Uwezo Soko Hub.
It is a web-based marketplace application where users can browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and simulate purchases.
